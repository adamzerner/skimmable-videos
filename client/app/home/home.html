  <h1>Skimmable Videos</h1>
  <p>Inspired by: Bret Victor's <a href="http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/">Media for Thinking the Unthinkable</a></p>
  <p>Skimmable videos are awesome. I want to make it easy for anyone to create their own skims.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I publish talks because this work is best conveyed through live demos — show-and-tell — and the "talk" is a medium that supports that.</p>
  <p>But a talk is a poor knowledge-container. It's opaque. The viewer can't skim, browse, or get a gist at a glance. Ideas can't be looked up as needed; they feel fleeting. The medium works well for entertainment — watch and enjoy — but not for a toolbox.</p>
  <p>This page is an attempt to "explode" a demo-driven talk into a skimmable, browsable, gistable form, where individual ideas can be quickly referenced later.</p>
  <p>Coming at the problem from the other direction — a well-designed paper can be skimmed and referenced, but typically can't show and tell. For an attempt to incorporate live demos into prose, see <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">Learnable Programming</a>.</p>
